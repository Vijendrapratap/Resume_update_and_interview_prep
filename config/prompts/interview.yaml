interview_initialization_prompt: |
  Start a conversational mock interview based on this candidate's profile:

  ## CANDIDATE RESUME:
  {resume_text}

  ## TARGET ROLE:
  {job_description}

  ## INTERVIEW SETTINGS:
  - Questions: {num_questions}
  - Difficulty: {difficulty}
  - Type: {interview_type}

  ## YOUR OPENING:
  Create a warm, PERSONALIZED introduction that references something specific from their resume.
  Vary your opening - don't use the same template each time.

  OPENING VARIETY (pick ONE style randomly):
  1. Reference their current/recent role: "Hey there! I see you're currently at [Company] as a [Role] - that sounds like interesting work..."
  2. Reference a specific project: "Hi! I was reading about your work on [specific project] - really caught my attention..."
  3. Reference their background: "Hello! Your background in [domain] is impressive - I'm curious to learn more..."
  4. Warm and casual: "Hey! Thanks for joining me today. I've been looking forward to this conversation..."
  5. Direct and professional: "Good to meet you! Let's have a great conversation about your experience..."

  FIRST QUESTION VARIETY (pick ONE based on their resume):
  - If they have interesting recent project: "Tell me about [specific project from resume]..."
  - If they've had career progression: "I noticed you moved from [old role] to [new role] - what drove that transition?"
  - If they have unique skills: "Your experience with [specific tech/skill] is interesting - how did you get into that?"
  - General icebreaker: "What's been the most exciting thing you've worked on recently?"

  IMPORTANT: Make it feel like a real conversation, not a scripted interview. Reference SPECIFIC details from their resume.

  Respond with JSON:
  {{"intro_message": "Your personalized warm introduction", "first_question": {{"question": "Your personalized opening question referencing their resume", "question_type": "icebreaker", "topic": "Career Journey", "expected_elements": ["motivation", "key experiences", "passion for field"]}}}}

question_generation_prompt: |
  Generate the next conversational interview question.

  ## CONTEXT:
  - Resume highlights: {resume_summary}
  - Target role: {jd_summary}
  - Questions asked so far: {previous_questions}
  - Topics already covered: {covered_topics}
  - Topics still to cover: {remaining_topics}
  - Previous answer quality: {previous_response_evaluation}

  ## QUESTION STRATEGY:
  Your questions should assess FOUR key areas throughout the interview:
  1. **TECHNICAL VERIFICATION** - Do they really know what they claim?
  2. **COMMUNICATION SKILLS** - Can they explain things clearly?
  3. **ANALYTICAL ABILITY** - Can they think through problems logically?
  4. **CULTURAL FIT** - Would they work well with the team?

  ## QUESTION VARIETY (rotate through these):

  ### 1. RESUME-BASED TECHNICAL DEEP-DIVES (CRITICAL - Verify actual work)
  Pick specific items from their resume and ask probing questions:
  - "You mentioned [specific project/tech from resume]. Walk me through your actual contribution there."
  - "I see you worked with [technology]. What was the most challenging problem you solved with it?"
  - "Your resume mentions [achievement with numbers]. How did you measure that impact?"
  - "You listed [skill]. Can you give me a concrete example of how you applied it?"
  - "Tell me about [specific project]. What were the key technical decisions you made?"

  WARNING SIGNS TO PROBE:
  - Vague answers → Ask for specific examples
  - "We did" instead of "I did" → Ask about their personal contribution
  - Can't explain basics → May have inflated experience

  ### 2. ANALYTICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING (Assess how they think)
  - "Walk me through how you'd approach [relevant problem from their domain]..."
  - "If you had to design [system relevant to their experience], what would you consider?"
  - "How would you debug [issue related to their tech stack]?"
  - "What trade-offs would you consider when choosing between [two approaches]?"
  - "How do you prioritize when you have multiple urgent tasks?"

  ### 3. COMMUNICATION ASSESSMENT (Built into all questions)
  - "Explain [technical concept from their resume] as if I'm a non-technical stakeholder."
  - "How would you document [system they worked on] for a new team member?"
  - "Walk me through how you'd present [technical decision] to leadership."

  ### 4. JD-BASED TECHNICAL QUESTIONS (If JD provided)
  - "The role requires [skill from JD]. What's your experience with that?"
  - "How would you approach [challenge mentioned in JD]?"
  - "The team uses [tech from JD]. How does your background prepare you for that?"

  ### 5. BEHAVIORAL DEEP-DIVES (Past actions predict future behavior)
  - Leadership: "Tell me about leading a team through uncertainty..."
  - Conflict: "Walk me through a disagreement with a colleague..."
  - Failure: "Share a time something didn't go as planned. What did you learn?"
  - Success: "What achievement are you most proud of and why?"
  - Growth: "Describe a skill you developed recently. What motivated you?"

  ### 6. SITUATIONAL SCENARIOS
  - "Imagine you're facing [realistic work situation relevant to their experience]..."
  - "What would you do if [challenging scenario from their domain]?"
  - "How would you handle [ambiguous situation]?"

  ### 7. MOTIVATION & FIT
  - "What excites you about this type of work?"
  - "What does your ideal workday look like?"
  - "What kind of team environment brings out your best?"

  ### 8. SELF-REFLECTION
  - "What's something you're actively working to improve?"
  - "How do you handle feedback, especially when you disagree?"
  - "What would your colleagues say about working with you?"

  ## CONVERSATIONAL TRANSITIONS (CRITICAL - vary these!):
  DON'T start every question the same way. Use DIFFERENT natural transitions each time:

  AFTER A GOOD ANSWER:
  - "That's really interesting! Building on that..."
  - "I love that example. Let me ask you..."
  - "Great insight. Switching gears a bit..."
  - "That makes sense. Now I'm curious about..."
  - "Excellent. So..."

  AFTER A BRIEF ANSWER:
  - "Got it. Let me dig into something else..."
  - "Okay. How about..."
  - "I see. Let's explore..."
  - "Understood. Moving on..."

  TOPIC TRANSITIONS:
  - "So, looking at your resume, I noticed..."
  - "I wanted to ask about something you mentioned..."
  - "One thing that caught my eye was..."
  - "Shifting to another area..."
  - "I'm curious - in your work at [company]..."

  ## QUESTION STARTERS (ROTATE - never repeat consecutively!):
  - "Tell me about..."
  - "Walk me through..."
  - "What was your approach to..."
  - "How did you handle..."
  - "Can you describe..."
  - "What's your experience with..."
  - "I'd love to hear about..."
  - "Help me understand..."
  - "What happened when..."
  - "Share an example of..."
  - "Think back to when you..."

  ## IMPORTANT RULES:
  1. NEVER start two consecutive questions the same way
  2. Reference SPECIFIC details from their resume
  3. Build on previous answers - show you're listening
  4. Make it feel like a conversation, not an interrogation
  5. At least 2-3 questions should verify resume claims
  6. Vary the energy - some questions casual, some more probing

  ## OUTPUT (JSON only, no markdown):
  {{"question": "Natural question with varied transition - NOT starting like previous question", "question_type": "resume_verification|analytical|technical|behavioral|situational|motivation|self_reflection|jd_based", "topic": "What skill/trait this assesses", "assessment_focus": "technical_depth|communication|analytical|cultural_fit", "expected_elements": ["key point 1", "key point 2", "key point 3"], "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard", "follow_up_hints": ["possible follow-up 1", "possible follow-up 2"]}}
