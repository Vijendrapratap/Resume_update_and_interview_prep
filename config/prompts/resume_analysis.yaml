# Prompt for Career Gap & Red Flag Analysis
gap_analysis_prompt: |
  Analyze the following resume for RED FLAGS, CAREER GAPS, and AUTHENTICITY CONCERNS.

  ## RESUME:
  {resume_text}

  ## RED FLAG DETECTION - Analyze for:

  ### 1. TIMELINE ISSUES
  - Career gaps longer than 3 months (unexplained)
  - Overlapping dates (working two full-time jobs simultaneously)
  - Vague date ranges (only years, no months)
  - Experience math doesn't add up (claimed years vs actual timeline)

  ### 2. SKILL INFLATION INDICATORS
  - Buzzword stuffing (too many technologies for the experience level)
  - Claims of expertise without supporting evidence
  - Senior titles with junior-level experience
  - Mismatch between skills listed and work descriptions

  ### 3. AUTHENTICITY CONCERNS
  - Generic/templated descriptions (no specific details)
  - No quantified achievements (no metrics, no numbers)
  - Unrealistic claims (e.g., "increased revenue by 500%")
  - Copy-paste job descriptions across roles

  ### 4. JOB HOPPING PATTERN
  - Multiple roles under 1 year
  - Pattern of short tenures
  - Lateral moves without growth

system_prompt: |
  You are an expert technical recruiter with 15+ years of experience screening candidates.
  Your job is to extract and present the most valuable information from resumes so hiring managers can quickly assess candidates.

  Focus on FACTS from the resume. Extract every skill, technology, and achievement mentioned.
  Be thorough - don't miss any technical skills or tools mentioned anywhere in the resume.

  IMPORTANT RULES:
  1. Be honest about gaps - if the resume lacks something, say so
  2. Identify potential red flags (job hopping, unexplained gaps, vague descriptions)
  3. Look for authenticity indicators - specific metrics, named technologies, concrete outcomes
  4. Assess communication quality based on how well the resume is written
  5. ALWAYS extract technical skills - scan the ENTIRE resume including job descriptions, projects, and skills sections
  6. Return valid JSON only - no markdown, no code blocks, just raw JSON

# Prompt for analysis WITHOUT a job description
analysis_without_jd_prompt: |

  You MUST calculate and provide ALL these scores as integer values 0-100:

  **Score each dimension:**
  - **skills_score** (0-100): Technical skills breadth, depth, and relevance
    - 90-100: Expert-level skills, industry certifications, cutting-edge tech
    - 70-89: Strong skills, good breadth, relevant experience
    - 50-69: Adequate skills, some gaps
    - Below 50: Significant skill gaps

  - **experience_score** (0-100): Years of experience, career progression, achievements
    - 90-100: 10+ years, strong progression, quantified achievements
    - 70-89: 5-10 years, good trajectory, some measurable impact
    - 50-69: 2-5 years, steady growth
    - Below 50: Limited experience or unclear progression

  - **education_score** (0-100): Degrees, certifications, continuous learning
    - 90-100: Advanced degree from top institution + multiple certifications
    - 70-89: Relevant degree + some certifications
    - 50-69: Bachelor's degree in related field
    - Below 50: No relevant degree or certifications

  - **quality_score** (0-100): Resume clarity, professionalism, communication

    - 70-89: Good clarity, organized, mostly measurable results
    - 50-69: Readable but vague, few specifics
    - Below 50: Poor formatting, generic descriptions

  - **technical_score**: Set equal to skills_score
  - **overall_score**: Calculate as: round((skills_score × 0.4) + (experience_score × 0.3) + (education_score × 0.2) + (quality_score × 0.1))

  ### 10. RED FLAG ASSESSMENT
  Analyze for concerns and assign:
  - **red_flag_count** (0-10): Number of concerns identified

  - "skills_match_available": false - Cannot assess if skills match requirements without JD
  - "gap_analysis_available": false - Cannot identify missing skills without JD
  - "role_fit_available": false - Cannot assess specific role fit without JD
